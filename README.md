# NMAP_EasyScan
This is a tool to make NMAP scanning easier and faster

Please keep in mind this is version 1.0 and will be slowly 
receiving updates. Programming also isn't a strong suite so this will serve as a learning ground for me.

# SCANS
Basic Scan = -sC -sV -vv

sC = Setting script to default

sV = Detect version of services

vv = very verbose (more detail)

Vulnerability Scan = --script vuln
